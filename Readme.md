# Eventbrite UI Kit

## Introduction

In this project, you will learn how to build UI components using a pre-made UI kit. Previously, you learned how to create a UI kit from scratch and define a visual identity, which is a great start for creating visually appealing websites. Today, we'll provide you with a pre-made UI kit, and you'll be tasked with constructing molecules and organisms using this kit. The goal is to code the key molecules that will make up 80% of your site, so you can easily insert them for a stunning front-end.

## Project Overview

For this project, we'll start with a pre-made UI kit. This approach offers two main advantages:

1. All atoms are already designed, including tables, forms, alerts, and more. This eliminates the risk of overlooking any elements, ensuring you're ready to create top-notch molecules and organisms.

2. Using a pre-made UI kit simplifies layout design thanks to Bootstrap's layout system.

You will be tasked with creating the following molecules and organisms:

- **Navbar**: Navigation bar
- **Footer**: Bottom section of the page
- **Authentication Form Organism**: A form for user authentication
- **Banner**: Prominent banner section
- **Multiple Presentation Card Formats**: Various card designs for presenting information
- **Card List Organisms**: Organisms representing lists of presentation cards
- **Comment Molecule**: Individual comment component
- **Comment Section Organism**: Organism representing a section for comments
- **Resource Presentation Section**: Section presenting information about a resource
- **Element Presentation Section**: Section presenting an element, with text on the left and an image on the right
- **Custom Organism**: An organism of your choice

## Project Organization

For organization, you will create an `index.html` file that displays links to pages containing the relevant molecules and organisms. Each component will have its own HTML file, such as `navbar.html`, `footer.html`, `authentification_form.html`, `banner.html`, etc. The CSS code will be placed in a single `style.css` file, which will be included in all your HTML pages.

Finally, you will envision this project for your Eventbrite application. Tomorrow, you will insert all the molecules into your application when we demonstrate the power of atomic design combined with Rails.
